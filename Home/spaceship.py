#Write a program that will (depending on Sofia and the old manâ€™s initial bargaining sums--the steps by which they will increase or decrease the price during their negotiations) calculate which final price they will agree upon. If Sofia's offer is lower than or equal to the old man's offer, she will accept the old man's price and vice versa.
#Sofi makes her offer first. She never offers an amount higher than what is offered to her. On the other hand, the old man never offers an amount lower than what is offered to him.
#Input data: Contains four integer numbers: Sofia's initial offer, Sofia's raise to her offer, the initial counteroffer from the old man, and the old man's reduction in his offer;
#Output data: The amount of money that Sofia will pay for the spaceship.
#Example:
#checkio([150, 50, 1000, 100]) == 450
#Sofi: 200
#Oldman: 900
#Sofi: 250
#Oldman: 800
#Sofi: 300
#Oldman: 700
#Sofi: 350
#Oldman: 600
#Sofi: 400
#Oldman: 500
#Sofi: 450
#... old man will be ok with it, because his next proposition will be lower than 450.
# a bit shorter example
#checkio([500, 300, 700, 100]) == 700
#Sofi will be ok with 700 because her next proposition will be higher
